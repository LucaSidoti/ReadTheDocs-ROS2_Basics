MICRO-453 | ROS2 Basics
=======================

Welcome to the **ROS2 Basics** labs!

This course consists of three hands-on practical sessions. Before each session, you will be required to complete a set of **preparatory tasks** to ensure you are ready to fully engage with the material. 

All the course content is available on this **Read the Docs** platform, enabling smooth transition between sessions and easy access to code snippets.

By the end of this course, you will have gained a solid understanding of:

- What ROS2 is and its role in robotics
- How to create and structure a ROS2 project
- **Key ROS2 concepts**: `nodes, topics, publishers, subscribers, services, servers, clients, interfaces, parameters, launch files`
- **Basic debugging tools**: `ros2 CLI, rqt_graph`
- What **URDF** is and how to design it with transforms (**TFs**)
- How to use **RViz** for visualization and **Gazebo** for simulation

We hope these labs will provide you with both the knowledge and practical experience to confidently work with ROS2 in your future robotics projects.
