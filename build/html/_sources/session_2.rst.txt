Session 2
=========

Introduction
------------

Welcome to session 2 of our ROS2 Basics labs! Today, we will be exploring the visualization and simulation tools integrated with ROS2. In this session, we will dive into Rviz, Transforms (TFs), launch files, URDF, Xacro, and Gazebo, building the essential skills for designing and simulating robotic systems.

Our main goal for today is to create a model of the Thymio robot that is fully integrated with ROS2 and capable of smooth operation in Gazebo simulation. We will guide you step by step through the essential elements needed to achieve this. You will begin with simple examples to introduce each concept and gradually apply this knowledge to build the Thymio model. Now, let's get to work!


URDF Tutorial Example
---------------------

In this first part of the session, we will start by exploring **Rviz**, a 3D visualization tool, and **TFs** (transform frames), which are essential for managing coordinate frames in ROS2. We will use an example **URDF** (Unified Robot Description Format) model to learn how to visualize and interact with a robot model in Rviz. Do not worry if these concepts do not fully make sense yet, we will go through each of them step by step throughout today’s session. 

Let’s get started by ensuring that everything we need is installed and set up. The first step is to install the *urdf_tutorial* package. This package is not part of the default ROS2 installation, so let's install it now.

1. Open a terminal and run:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt install ros-humble-urdf-tutorial && source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash

.. note::

    If you have been paying attention to the terminal messages, you may have noticed that this package is already installed in the Docker environment. Due to time considerations, we have not covered all the steps of the installation process. However, the following outlines the general procedure you can follow to install any new package in ROS2.

    +-------+----------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+

    .. raw:: html

        </div>

2. Let’s check where this package and others are installed:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd /opt/ros/humble/share && ls

3. Navigate to the URDF folder of the *urdf_tutorial* package and check its content:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd /opt/ros/humble/share/urdf_tutorial/urdf && ls

Among the files listed, you will see `08-macroed.urdf.xacro`, which is the example we will use now.

4. Launch the example:

.. code-block:: bash

    ros2 launch urdf_tutorial display.launch.py model:=/opt/ros/humble/share/urdf_tutorial/urdf/08-macroed.urdf.xacro

Now that Rviz is running and the robot model is loaded, let’s take a moment to explore what Rviz offers and why it is such a valuable tool in the ROS2 ecosystem. Visualizing the robot in a 3D environment provides an intuitive way to understand its structure, relationships, and interactions.

In particular, Rviz allows you to visualize:

    * **Robot models**: These are detailed representations of the robot’s physical structure.
    * **Transform frames (TFs)**: Coordinate frames that define the spatial relationships between different parts of the robot, essential for motion and interaction.
    * **Sensors data**:  Information from sensors such as LiDAR, cameras, or depth sensors, displayed in real-time to help interpret the robot’s environment.

As you can see in the image below, Rviz offers a variety of default plugins that enable you to monitor different aspects of your system. These plugins can be accessed and added to your workspace by clicking the ``Add`` button in the Rviz interface.

.. image:: img/rviz_plugins.png
    :align: center
    :width: 20%

.. |spacer| raw:: html

    <div style="margin-top: 5px;"></div>

|spacer|

Rviz also allows you to interact with tools like the *Joint State Publisher* (the second pop-up window), a GUI that lets you manipulate the robot’s joints. This enables you to see how joint movements affect the robot’s structure.

A key question to consider here is: **How does ROS2 determine the positions and movements of the different links relative to one another over time?**

The answer lies in **Transform Frames (TFs)**. These frames represent the spatial relationships (positions and orientations) between the robot’s parts and its environment. TFs enable ROS2 to continuously track how each part of the robot moves in relation to others. By maintaining structured relationships between frames, TFs play a crucial role in various robotic tasks.

Each frame has three axes: x (red), y (green), and z (blue), representing its orientation in 3D space. If you uncheck the ``RobotModel`` in Rviz, you can see that the TFs form a tree-like structure, showing how the robot’s rigid parts are connected.

To better visualize the TF hierarchy, you can use the *view_frames* tool provided by the *tf2_tools* package. Open a terminal and run:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/ros2_basics_ws/
    ros2 run tf2_tools view_frames 

After about five seconds, a PDF will be generated in your workspace. This file provides a clear tree structure of the robot’s TFs. The ``base_link`` is the root of the TF tree, and all other frames are connected as branches. Each branch connects a **parent link** to a **child link**, meaning that if the parent link moves, the child link will move accordingly.

Now that you understand the purpose of TFs, you can experiment in Rviz to see how they work alongside the ``RobotModel``. Start by focusing on the ``RobotModel``:

1. Hide TFs and explore the ``RobotModel`` by displaying all links or only a few.
2. Adjust joints using the *Joint State Publisher* and observe changes.

Next, enable the TFs and hide the ``RobotModel`` to focus on the transform frames:

1. Display all or specific frames to examine their relationships.
2. Observe how frames update dynamically with joint adjustments.

By now, you should have a foundational understanding of Rviz and TFs. Here’s a quick recap:

    * **Rviz** is a visualization tool that helps display robot models, TFs, and many other essential elements .
    * **TFs** are essential for representing spatial relationships and movement between different parts of the robot.

These tools are invaluable for building and visualizing robot models in ROS2.

Let’s keep going! In the next chapters, we will dive deeper into understanding and working with URDF files to create our own robot model.

Launch Files Overview
---------------------

At this stage, you have already visualized a robot model in Rviz using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    ros2 launch urdf_tutorial display.launch.py model:=<path_to_urdf>

You might have been wondering, what does the *launch* command do? Simply put, it runs a **launch file**. A launch file is a configuration file that allows you to start multiple nodes simultaneously, often with specific parameters or remapping. This is especially useful when managing complex setups, as launching multiple nodes manually from different terminals can quickly become difficult to manage.

Launch files provide a structured way to:

* Start multiple nodes simultaneously
* Apply specific parameters
* Remap topics and services
* Load additional configurations

Launch files can be written in **Python**, **XML**, or **YAML**. For simplicity and conciseness, we will use the XML format in this course.

.. admonition:: Action Required

    Please :download:`Download <downloads/thymio_description.zip>` the ``thymio_description`` package required for this session and place it in the ``/src`` directory of your ``ros2_basics_ws`` workspace.

.. note::

    Following a common convention, a robot's model is typically stored in a package named ``<robot_name>_description``, which organizes related files into structured folders. In our case, the ``thymio_description`` package contains several folders (*launch*, *rviz*, *urdf*, and *worlds*) that will be gradually filled with additional content as we progress.
    
    Keep in mind that when new folders are added to a package, they are not automatically recognized by ROS2. To make them accessible, they must be installed in the package's ``/share`` directory. If you check the *setup.py* file, you will notice that this step has already been handled for you.

Let’s revisit an example from Session 1, illustrated in the image below, to better understand launch files. This time, instead of manually starting each node, we will use a launch file to simultaneously launch four nodes with their appropriate configurations.

.. image:: img/task2.png
    :align: center
    :width: 60%

|spacer|

1. Open the file *example.launch.xml*

   Navigate to the */thymio_description/launch* folder and open the *example.launch.xml* file.

2. Add the following code to the file

   .. code-block:: xml

       <launch>
           <node pkg="demo_nodes_py" exec="talker" name="stress">
               <remap from="chatter" to="exams"/>
           </node>

           <node pkg="demo_nodes_py" exec="talker" name="BA1_students">
               <remap from="chatter" to="exams"/>
           </node>

           <node pkg="demo_nodes_py" exec="listener" name="BA2">
               <remap from="chatter" to="exams"/>
           </node>

           <node pkg="demo_nodes_py" exec="listener" name="MAN">
               <remap from="chatter" to="exams"/>
           </node>
       </launch>

..

    .. admonition:: Question

        What are the essential elements of a launch file?

|spacer|

3. Build and source the package

   .. code-block:: bash

        cd ~/ros2_basics_ws/
        colcon build --packages-select thymio_description
        source install/setup.bash

4. Run the launch file

   .. code-block:: bash

       ros2 launch thymio_description example.launch.xml 

5. Visualize the result

   .. code-block:: bash

       rqt_graph

.. note:: 

    Using a launch file, you have successfully started multiple nodes with a single command. Additionally, remapping topics has become significantly more convenient.

To save time during this class, we will not go over the creation of the launch files required for this session, as they are more advanced than the basic example we have just seen. Instead, the necessary launch files are already prepared and included in the ``thymio_description`` package. But don't despair! We will revisit and analyze these files in detail during Preparatory Work 3.

URDF Overview
-------------

In the introductory example, the need for TFs (Transform Frames) in robotics was highlighted. TFs play a crucial role in tracking the positions of different parts of a robot over time. They are essential for most control packages in ROS2 to function effectively.

For example:

* **Odometry** in navigation requires the positions of the wheels to estimate a mobile robot's pose.
* **Robotic arms** need joint positions to calculate the pose of the end-effector.

In short, accurate TFs are vital for running a robot in ROS2. Fortunately, ROS2 handles the management of TFs. The only requirement is to provide a **URDF file**, which describes the robot's elements in **XML format**.

A URDF, Unified Robot Description Format, consists of two main components:

* **Links**: Represent the physical, rigid parts of the robot. These correspond to the ``RobotModel`` in Rviz.
* **Joints**: Define the relationships between links and are used by ROS2 to generate TFs.

.. figure:: img/urdf.png
   :align: center
   :width: 40%

   `URDF representation <https://web.enib.fr/~buche/data/IML/class_ROS2_tools.html>`_

Links are the rigid bodies of a robot. They can be described using one of the four types of geometry: **boxes**, **cylinders**, **spheres**, and **meshes**.

.. note::

    In this class, only basic geometry shapes will be used. While meshes can be included in a URDF, they require a CAD-designed mesh file (e.g. an STL file). When using meshes, it is important to pay attention to scaling and orientation.

To fully define a link, three properties must be specified:

* **Visual**: How the link appears in visualization tools
* **Inertial**: The physical properties (mass, center of gravity, etc.)
* **Collision**: The geometry used for collision detection

These properties will be introduced progressively throughout the session.

.. figure:: img/links.png
   :align: center
   :width: 50%

   `Link representation <http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/XML/link>`_

Joints define the connections between links. The most common types of joints in ROS2 are:

1. **Fixed**: No movement between the parent and child links
2. **Revolute**: Rotation around a single axis within a defined range
3. **Continuous**: Rotation around a single axis without limits
4. **Prismatic**: Linear motion along a single axis

A joint is always defined by its **parent link** and **child link**.

Minimal URDF - Visual
---------------------

With the necessary theoretical background covered, we can now move on to our first robot model. We will use the pre-existing *example.urdf* file provided in the ``thymio_description`` package. Navigate to the */urdf/example* directory and open the *example.urdf* file.

First Link 
~~~~~~~~~~

Fill the *example.urdf* file with the first link:

1.Define the structure of the URDF file

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <robot name="example">

    </robot>

This structure specifies the XML format and gives a name to the robot model.

2. Add a link with visual properties

.. code-block:: xml 

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <robot name="example">
    
        <link name="base_link">
            <visual>    
                <origin xyz="0 0 0"  rpy="0 0 0"/>
                <geometry>
                    <box size="0.2 0.3 0.6"/>
                </geometry>
            </visual>
        </link>

    </robot>

The **base_link** is a standard name for the core element of a robot. Its dimensions are specified in meters. The **origin** uses **xyz** for position and **rpy** (roll, pitch, yaw) for orientation.

.. note::

    Tags in XML must be opened (e.g. ``<visual>``) and closed (e.g. ``</visual>``). If a tag is empty, it can be written as a self-closing tag (e.g. ``<box size="0.2 0.3 0.6"/>`` instead of ``<box size="0.2 0.3 0.6"> </box>``).

3. Visualize the box in Rviz

First, build the package. Since more components will be added shortly, it is convenient to use the ``--symlink-install`` option for quicker updates.

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/ros2_basics_ws
    colcon build --packages-select thymio_description --symlink-install
    source install/setup.bash

.. warning::

    This command is useful when working with URDF as it allows you to progressively verify your progress. However, remember to rebuild the package whenever you add a new file.

Now, we are ready to visualize the result. Use the following command to launch the URDF in Rviz.

.. code-block:: bash

    ros2 launch thymio_description example_display_urdf.launch.xml 

We have successfully created a box with dimensions: 20 cm in length (x-direction), 30 cm in width (y-direction), and 10 cm in height (z-direction). However, it appears with a default color in Rviz. Let’s modify it to add a custom color.

4. Add color to the visual

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <robot name="example">

        <material name="blue">
            <color rgba="0 0 1 1" />
        </material>

        <link name="base_link">
            <visual>    
                <origin xyz="0 0 0"  rpy="0 0 0"/>
                <geometry>
                    <box size="0.2 0.3 0.6"/>
                </geometry>
                <material name="blue"/>
            </visual>
        </link>

    </robot>

Colors are defined using the ``<material>`` tag. A common practice is to define colors at the top of the file and reference them by name in the ``<visual>`` tag. The color attributes include four arguments: **rgb** for red, green, and blue, and **a** for transparency.

View the result in Rviz using the same command as before (rebuilding the package is not necessary). 

First Joint
~~~~~~~~~~~

Fill the *example.urdf* file with the first joint:

To introduce joints, we will add a second link and then connect it to the base link.

1. Define a second link

.. code-block:: xml 

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <robot name="example">

        <material name="blue">
            <color rgba="0 0 1 1" />
        </material>

        <link name="base_link">
            <visual>    
                <origin xyz="0 0 0"  rpy="0 0 0"/>
                <geometry>
                    <box size="0.2 0.3 0.6"/>
                </geometry>
                <material name="blue"/>
            </visual>
        </link>

        <link name="second_link">
            <visual>
                <origin xyz="0 0 0" rpy="0 0 0"/>
                <geometry>
                    <cylinder length="0.8" radius="0.05"/>
                </geometry>
                <material name="blue"/>
            </visual>
        </link>

    </robot>

Here, we have simply added a second link with a different shape. The name can be chosen arbitrarily. You can try visualizing it in Rviz.

.. error:: 

    The result cannot be visualized yet because unconnected links are not allowed. Let’s resolve this by adding a joint.


2. Create a joint between the links

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <robot name="example">

        <material name="blue">
            <color rgba="0 0 1 1" />
        </material>

        <link name="base_link">
            <visual>    
                <origin xyz="0 0 0"  rpy="0 0 0"/>
                <geometry>
                    <box size="0.2 0.3 0.6"/>
                </geometry>
                <material name="blue"/>
            </visual>
        </link>

        <link name="second_link">
            <visual>
                <origin xyz="0 0 0" rpy="0 0 0"/>
                <geometry>
                    <cylinder length="0.8" radius="0.05"/>
                </geometry>
                <material name="blue"/>
            </visual>
        </link>

        <joint name="second_link_joint" type="fixed">
            <parent link="base_link"/>
            <child link="second_link"/>
            <origin xyz="0 0 0" rpy="0 0 0"/>
        </joint>

    </robot>

The second link has been added. Use a naming convention for the joint that makes it easy to identify. As mentioned earlier, a joint is defined by its **type**, **parent link**, and **child link**. Additionally, it includes an **origin**, which specifies its position and orientation relative to the parent link. Now, let’s visualize this in Rviz.

3. Set the origins

We have not discussed origins yet, as they can be a bit confusing when working with URDF for the first time. To simplify, we will provide a straightforward approach to correctly position your links. This step is critical for creating a robot model that works accurately in simulation.

As mentioned earlier, ROS2 uses the URDF file to generate the robot's TFs. If the joints are not properly placed, the TFs will also be misaligned, leading to unexpected behavior during simulation.

Let’s go through a simple four-step process to correctly position two links. Currently, our setup looks like this:


.. image:: img/urdf_step1.png
    :align: center
    :width: 25%

|spacer|

Our goal now is to replicate this: 

.. image:: img/urdf_step4b.png
    :align: center
    :width: 50%

|spacer|

For each of the following steps, observe the provided code and its corresponding visualization in Rviz. Carefully review the changes and reflect on the purpose of each origin setting. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. It is crucial to understand this process as you will need to apply it when building the Thymio model yourself.

.. admonition:: Procedure

    1. Set all origins to zero (this is already the case)

    .. code-block:: xml

        <origin xyz="0 0 0" rpy="0 0 0"/>

                <geometry>
                    <box size="0.2 0.3 0.6"/>
                </geometry>

            <parent link="base_link"/>
            <child link="second_link"/>
            <origin xyz="0.1 0 0.3" rpy="0 0 0"/>

    Which origin setting is most critical for ensuring that your robot's movements and positions are accurately represented in ROS2 simulations?

4. Explore the different joint types

Now, let’s experiment with the two links by trying out different joint types. Simply replace the existing joint with one of the examples below. For each joint type, visualize the result in Rviz and use the Joint State Publisher GUI to observe how the parts move. 

    1. **Revolute** - Rotation around a single axis within a defined range

    .. code-block:: xml

        <joint name="second_link_joint" type="revolute">
            <parent link="base_link"/>
            <child link="second_link"/>
            <origin xyz="0.1 0 0.3" rpy="0 0 0"/>
            <axis xyz="1 0 0"/>
            <limit lower="-1.57" upper="1.57" velocity="10" effort="10"/>
        </joint>

    2. **Continuous** - Rotation around a single axis without limits

    .. code-block:: xml

        <joint name="second_link_joint" type="continuous">
            <parent link="base_link"/>
            <child link="second_link"/>
            <origin xyz="0.1 0 0.3" rpy="0 0 0"/>
            <axis xyz="1 0 0"/>
        </joint>

    3. **Prismatic** - Linear motion along a single axis

    .. code-block:: xml

        <joint name="second_link_joint" type="prismatic">
            <parent link="base_link"/>
            <child link="second_link"/>
            <origin xyz="0.1 0 0.3" rpy="0 0 0"/>
            <axis xyz="1 0 0"/>
            <limit lower="0.0" upper="0.5" velocity="10" effort="10"/>
        </joint>

Reaching this point means you now have a better understanding of what a URDF is. You are equipped with the essential tools to finally practice building your first robot model on your own. Let’s get started!

Thymio - Step 1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As mentioned in the introduction, today's goal is to create a Thymio model that works well in simulation. The task is divided into 6 steps, and the journey begins now with your first challenge: creating the visual representation of the Thymio using the tools just introduced.

.. admonition:: Thymio

    Start by creating a new file named *thymio.urdf* in the */urdf/thymio* directory. Follow the provided specifications to guide you through the process. Make sure to frequently visualize your progress in Rviz using the following command:

Improved URDF - Xacro
---------------------

Congratulations on completing the simplified Thymio model! Now, to prepare for the next step, consider this question: **What happens if we change the dimensions of the base_link?**

Try answering this by modifying the width of the ``base_link`` to 6.6 cm instead of 11.2 cm.

You will notice that the wheels are no longer correctly aligned with the sides of the ``base_link``. This is because the current URDF uses hardcoded values. Any change to one dimension requires manual updates to other dependent dimensions. While manageable for a small file, this approach is likely to cause mistakes and become inefficient for larger models.

In programming, this problem is typically solved by using variables to define relationships between dimensions, ensuring automatic updates when one value changes. While URDF does not support variables, **Xacro**, an extension of URDF, solves this issue. Xacro allows for:

* **Parametrization**: Define variables for dynamic adjustments.
* **Simplification**: Use macros, constants, math operations, and conditional logic.
* **Modularity**: Organize your robot description into multiple files.

Therefore, a URDF can be rewritten using Xacro's extended syntax, allowing it to be organized across one or multiple files. These files are then processed by a *xacro* tool which combines them into a single, standard URDF file that ROS2 can interpret. Let’s apply this to our example and see how it works in practice.

1) Open *example.urdf.xacro* and *example_materials.xacro*

Navigate to the */urdf/example* directory and open the provided files with the *.xacro* extension.

.. note::

    To enhance understanding, we will go through the elements of the updated file step by step. You do not need to add these elements to the file yet, as the complete file will be provided at the end. Focus on understanding the process and the purpose of each element.

2) Xacro compatibility

To enable the use of xacro in our file, we need to adjust the ``<robot>`` tag as follow:

.. code-block:: xml

    <robot name="example" xmlns:xacro="http://wwww.ros.org/wiki/xacro">

3) Mathematical operations

Xacro enables various mathematical operations, including the use of the constant pi, often needed for adjusting link orientations. For example, the ``second_link`` origin can be rewritten as:

.. code-block:: xml

    <origin xyz="0.4 0 0" rpy="0 ${pi / 2.0} 0"/>

4) Variables

Variables can be defined like this:

.. code-block:: xml

    <xacro:property name="base_link_length" value="0.2"/>
    <xacro:property name="base_link_width" value="0.3"/>
    <xacro:property name="base_link_height" value="0.6"/>

And used as shown here:

.. code-block:: xml

    <box size="${base_link_length} ${base_link_width} ${base_link_height}"/>

5) Macros

Xacro supports defining reusable functions called macros. For example, a macro to define a box with length, width, and height as parameters can be written as:

.. code-block:: xml

    <xacro:macro name="box" params="length width height">
        <box size="${length} ${width} ${height}"/>
    </xacro:macro>

You can then call it at the desired location with the required parameters:

.. code-block:: xml

    <xacro:box length="${base_link_length}" width="${base_link_width}" height="${base_link_height}"/>

6) Multiple files

To simplify the process, it is a good practice to split the URDF into multiple files. Typically, one main file includes all other Xacro files. To distinguish them, use the extension *.urdf.xacro* for the main file and *.xacro* for the others. 

For example, materials can be defined in a separate file for clarity and reuse. This allows the main file to stay focused on the robot's structure. The new file follows the same structure as the main file but does not include a robot name:

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <robot xmlns:xacro="http://wwww.ros.org/wiki/xacro">

        <material name="blue">
            <color rgba="0 0 1 1"/>
        </material>

        <material name="green">
            <color rgba="0 1 0 1"/>
        </material>

    </robot>

This file contains reusable material definitions that can now be included in other Xacro files using the ``<xacro:include>`` tag, as shown below:

.. code-block:: xml

    <xacro:include filename="example_materials.xacro"/>

.. note::

    When including multiple files:

    .. code-block:: xml

        <xacro:include filename="file1.xacro"/>
        <xacro:include filename="file2.xacro"/>

    The second file can use variables or materials defined in the first file because it is included beforehand. You do not need to re-include *file1.xacro* in *file2.xacro*.

7) Update the files

a) Update *example_materials.xacro*

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <robot xmlns:xacro="http://wwww.ros.org/wiki/xacro">

        <material name="blue">
            <color rgba="0 0 1 1"/>
        </material>

        <material name="green">
            <color rgba="0 1 0 1"/>
        </material>

    </robot>


b) Update *example.urdf.xacro* file

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <robot name="example" xmlns:xacro="http://wwww.ros.org/wiki/xacro">

        <xacro:include filename="example_materials.xacro"/>

        <xacro:property name="base_link_length" value="0.2"/>
        <xacro:property name="base_link_width" value="0.3"/>
        <xacro:property name="base_link_height" value="0.6"/>
        <xacro:property name="second_link_length" value="0.8"/>
        <xacro:property name="second_link_radius" value="0.05"/>

        <xacro:macro name="box" params="length width height">
            <box size="${length} ${width} ${height}"/>
        </xacro:macro>

        <link name="base_link">
            <visual>    
                <origin xyz="0 0 ${base_link_height / 2.0}"  rpy="0 0 0"/>
                <geometry>
                    <xacro:box length="${base_link_length}" width="${base_link_width}" height="${base_link_height}"/>
                </geometry>
                <material name="green"/>
            </visual>
        </link>

        <link name="second_link">
            <visual>
                <origin xyz="${second_link_length / 2.0} 0 0" rpy="0 ${pi / 2.0} 0"/>
                <geometry>
                    <cylinder length="${second_link_length}" radius="${second_link_radius}"/>
                </geometry>
                <material name="blue"/>
            </visual>
        </link>

        <joint name="second_link_joint" type="fixed">
            <parent link="base_link"/>
            <child link="second_link"/>
            <origin xyz="${base_link_length / 2.0} 0 ${base_link_height / 2.0}" rpy="0 0 0"/>
        </joint>

    </robot>

.. note::

    Notice that the file no longer contains hardcoded values. Instead, five variables are used to define the links and joint accurately. While using a macro to define a single box may be excessive here, it serves to demonstrate how macros work.

8. Visualize the result in Rviz

.. code-block:: bash

    ros2 launch thymio_description example_display_xacro.launch.xml

Thymio - Step 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. admonition:: Thymio

    Let’s put this knowledge into practice. The goal is to enhance the previous URDF by utilizing Xacro's features. Follow these steps:

    1. Split the URDF into three files:

        * *materials.xacro*: Defines the colors
        * *thymio_chassis.xacro*: Contains the description of the robot
        * *thymio.urdf.xacro*: The main file that includes the other two files

    2. Use the pi constant where needed

    3. Define variables and replace hardcoded values

    4. Create a macro for the wheel links and reuse it for both wheels

    Additionally, remember to apply mathematical operations wherever possible.

    Use the following command to display the new model:

    .. code-block:: bash

        ros2 launch thymio_description thymio_display_xacro.launch.xml

    Once again, refer to the drawing below for the key dimensions:

    .. image:: img/thymio_spec.png
        :align: center
        :width: 60%

    |spacer|

    .. admonition:: Hints

        .. toggle::

            *  Eight variables are sufficient to define all links and joints: ``base_length``, ``base_width``, ``base_height``, ``ground_clearance``, ``caster_wheel_radius``, ``wheel_radius``, ``wheel_width``, ``wheel_offset``
            * Some variables can depend on others
            * Position the caster wheel and wheels relative to the base's length and width
            * The final visual, with the ``base_length`` increased and the ``base_width`` reduced by a factor of two, should appear as follows:

            .. image:: img/thymio_xacro.png
                :align: center
                :width: 60%

Gazebo Overview
---------------

Now, let's take the next step and introduce simulation into our workflow using **Gazebo**. Gazebo is a **physics-based simulation tool** that integrates with ROS2 to provide:

* A virtual environment for testing robot behaviors
* Accurate simulations of physical interactions and sensor outputs

Simulation is an essential part of robotics development for several reasons:

* **Algorithm testing**: Optimizes control algorithms in a repeatable, controlled environment
* **Physical interactions**: Models collisions, dynamics, gravity, inertia, and sensor noise
* **Sensors and actuators simulation**: Provides sensor data and enables actuator control

Gazebo is an independent tool and not a native part of the ROS2 environment. However, it integrates with ROS2 using the *gazebo_ros* package, which acts as a bridge between the two. This integration is made possible through various Gazebo plugins that allow interaction with the ROS2 ecosystem and simulation of robot hardware, including actuators and sensors.

.. note::

    To clarify the differences between **Rviz** and **Gazebo**, here is a summary table:

Complete URDF - Collision & Inertial
------------------------------------

So far, we have been focusing exclusively on the visual representation of the Thymio robot. To make the model functional in a simulation, the URDF must be updated to include collision and physical properties. These additions will enable the robot to interact realistically with the virtual environment. Let's begin by incorporating the collision properties.

Collision Tags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Launch our basic example in Rviz

.. code-block:: bash

    ros2 launch thymio_description example_display_xacro.launch.xml 

2. Adjust the Rviz configuration

Under the ``RobotModel`` options, uncheck *Visual Enabled* and check *Collision Enabled*. You will see that nothing appear. In fact, this is normal, we have not defined the collision properties yet.

3. Update *example.urdf.xacro*

To add collision properties to the links in the URDF, you need to include ``<collision>`` tags. These are similar to ``<visual>`` tags: both require an origin and a geometry. However, ``<collision>`` tags do **not** require a material definition.

Please update the file, which now includes the collision properties for the links:

.. code-block:: xml

    <link name="base_link">
        <visual>    
            <origin xyz="0 0 ${base_link_height / 2.0}"  rpy="0 0 0"/>
            <geometry>
                <xacro:box length="${base_link_length}" width="${base_link_width}" height="${base_link_height}"/>
            </geometry>
            <material name="green"/>
        </visual>
        <collision>    
            <origin xyz="0 0 ${base_link_height / 2.0}"  rpy="0 0 0"/>
            <geometry>
                <xacro:box length="${base_link_length}" width="${base_link_width}" height="${base_link_height}"/>
            </geometry>
        </collision>
    </link>

    <link name="second_link">
        <visual>
            <origin xyz="${second_link_length / 2.0} 0 0" rpy="0 ${pi / 2.0} 0"/>
            <geometry>
                <cylinder length="${second_link_length}" radius="${second_link_radius}"/>
            </geometry>
            <material name="blue"/>
        </visual>
        <collision>
            <origin xyz="${second_link_length / 2.0} 0 0" rpy="0 ${pi / 2.0} 0"/>
            <geometry>
                <cylinder length="${second_link_length}" radius="${second_link_radius}"/>
            </geometry>
        </collision>
    </link>

4. Verify the result in Rviz

.. admonition:: Question

    Is the geometry defined in the ``<collision>`` tag always identical to the visual geometry? You can base your reflection on the following example. Think about why they might differ and how this affects simulation and robot interactions.

Inertial Tags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now, let's focus on defining the physical properties of the model by adding the ``<inertial>`` tags. These tags play a crucial role in accurately simulating the robot's motion by specifying properties such as mass and moments of inertia. This ensures the model responds realistically to forces like gravity and other dynamics.

As you may recall from your physics courses, the formulas for the moment of inertia tensor are well-established for basic geometric shapes. These tensors are uniquely determined by the object's dimensions and mass. Let’s explore how to incorporate these inertia properties.

1. Open the *example_inertia.xacro* file

In the */urdf/example* directory, locate the provided *example_inertia.xacro* file. This file will be used to define reusable macros for the inertia properties of our basic shapes.

2. Add the inertia macros to the file

Like the other tags we have encountered, the ``<inertial>`` tag requires an origin to be defined. In addition, it needs a mass and an inertia matrix. Since this matrix is symmetric, only 6 of its 9 components need to be specified. You can consult the formulas for defining inertia matrices in the corresponding Wikipedia webpage: `List of 3D inertia tensors <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_moments_of_inertia#List_of_3D_inertia_tensors>`_.

                <inertia ixx="${(m/12) * (h*h + l*l)}" ixy="0" ixz="0"
                        iyy="${(m/12) * (w*w + l*l)}" iyz="0"
                        izz="${(m/12) * (w*w + h*h)}"/>
            </inertial>
        </xacro:macro>

        <xacro:macro name="cylinder_inertia" params="m r h xyz rpy">
            <inertial>
                <origin xyz="${xyz}" rpy="${rpy}"/>
                <mass value="${m}" />
                <inertia ixx="${(m/12) * (3*r*r + h*h)}" ixy="0" ixz="0"
                        iyy="${(m/12) * (3*r*r + h*h)}" iyz="0"
                        izz="${(m/2) * (r*r)}"/>
            </inertial>
        </xacro:macro>

    </robot>

3. Adjust *example.urdf.xacro*

To use the defined macros, include the previously created file and invoke them with the desired parameters. 

.. code-block:: xml

    <xacro:include filename="example_inertia.xacro"/>

    <xacro:property name="base_link_mass" value="0.5"/> <!-- Mass in [kg] -->
    <xacro:property name="second_link_mass" value="0.2"/> <!-- Mass in [kg] -->

    <link name="base_link">
        <visual>    
            <origin xyz="0 0 ${base_link_height / 2.0}"  rpy="0 0 0"/>
            <geometry>
                <xacro:box length="${base_link_length}" width="${base_link_width}" height="${base_link_height}"/>
            </geometry>
            <material name="green"/>
        </visual>
        <collision>    
            <origin xyz="0 0 ${base_link_height / 2.0}"  rpy="0 0 0"/>
            <geometry>
                <xacro:box length="${base_link_length}" width="${base_link_width}" height="${base_link_height}"/>
            </geometry>
        </collision>
        <xacro:box_inertia m="${base_link_mass}" l="${base_link_length}" w="${base_link_width}" h="${base_link_height}"
                           xyz="0 0 ${base_link_height / 2.0}"  rpy="0 0 0"/>
    </link>

    <link name="second_link">
        <visual>
            <origin xyz="${second_link_length / 2.0} 0 0" rpy="0 ${pi / 2.0} 0"/>
            <geometry>
                <cylinder length="${second_link_length}" radius="${second_link_radius}"/>
            </geometry>
            <material name="blue"/>
        </visual>
        <collision>
            <origin xyz="${second_link_length / 2.0} 0 0" rpy="0 ${pi / 2.0} 0"/>
            <geometry>
                <cylinder length="${second_link_length}" radius="${second_link_radius}"/>
            </geometry>
        </collision>
        <xacro:cylinder_inertia m="${second_link_mass}" r="${second_link_radius}" h="${second_link_length}" 
                                xyz="${second_link_length / 2.0} 0 0" rpy="0 ${pi / 2.0} 0"/>
    </link>

.. note::

    If you are interested, you can visualize the result in Rviz (*RobotModel > Mass Properties > Inertia*), but this method is not ideal for intuitively verifying the correctness of our implementation. Instead, we recommend testing the physical behavior directly in Gazebo. However, as we do not yet have all the necessary tools, we will revisit this step later.

Thymio - Step 3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. admonition:: Thymio

    The new task is to enhance the current Thymio model by adding ``<collision>`` and ``<inertial>`` tags. Follow the provided specifications carefully.

Spawn Robot in Gazebo
---------------------

Your Thymio robot is now set up and ready for simulation testing. Launch it in Gazebo using the command below:

.. code-block:: bash

    ros2 launch thymio_description thymio_gazebo.launch.xml

.. warning::

    Gazebo may occasionally crash when started. If this happens, terminate the launch process by pressing ``Ctrl+C`` and try again. This should resolve the issue.

In Gazebo, experiment with the physics to observe the robot's behavior:

* *Translation*: Press ``T``, click the robot, and drag to move or lift it. Try to make it fall.
* *Rotation*: Press ``R``, click the robot, and rotate or tilt it. Observe how it stabilizes.

After exploring the physics, go back to the URDF file. Comment out the ``<collision>`` tag for the wheel links, save the changes, and relaunch the simulation.

.. admonition:: Question

    What do you observe? How does the absence of a collision property affect the robot's interaction with its environment?

After addressing this question, revisit the URDF file, restore the ``<collision>`` tag, and now comment out the ``<inertial>`` tag for the wheels. Save your changes and relaunch the simulation.

.. admonition:: Question

    How does the behavior differ this time? Why do you think this occurs?

When finished, restore the URDF file to its original state. If you carefully observed the simulation results, you may have noticed two issues:

    1. The Thymio moves slightly on its own after spawning
    2. Colors are missing in Gazebo

Let’s tackle these one by one. The unexpected motion occurs because the simplified Thymio model lacks accurate inertia properties and precise mass values. To resolve this, we will adjust the dynamics of the wheel joints and reduce the friction of the caster wheel.

.. admonition:: Procedure

    1. Modify the wheel joint dynamics

    For each wheel joint, add the following line:

    .. code-block:: xml

        <dynamics damping="0.1" friction="0.2"/>

    2. Create a *gazebo.xacro* 

    Gazebo provides specific ``<gazebo>`` tags to define simulation properties. To keep things organized, create a new Xacro file, *gazebo.xacro*, where we will add all Gazebo-specific properties.

    3. Reduce the caster wheel friction

    The caster wheel in the current robot model adds too much friction and drags against the ground. To address this, add the following friction coefficients to the *gazebo.xacro* file:

    .. code-block:: xml

        <gazebo reference="caster_wheel_link">
            <mu1 value="0.31" />
            <mu2 value="0.31" />
        </gazebo>

    Do not forget to include *gazebo.xacro* in the *thymio.urdf.xacro* file to ensure the simulation properties are applied.

    After making these adjustments, the Thymio should remain stationary after spawning in Gazebo. Test the simulation to confirm the changes.

To address the missing colors, we can use ``<gazebo>`` tags to define materials for the links. For example, to apply a green color to a link named *example_link*:

.. code-block:: xml

    <gazebo reference="example_link">
        <material>Gazebo/Green</material>
    </gazebo>

Thymio - Step 4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. admonition:: Thymio

    Update the colors in *gazebo.xacro* to achieve the desired visual appearance in Gazebo.
    

Gazebo Plugins
--------------

Your Thymio is almost ready for simulation. The next step is to add control capabilities so the robot can move, and optionally, proximity sensors to detect obstacles. This chapter will guide you through these steps. Gazebo provides a range of plugins that simplify this process, as seen in the `gazebo_plugins <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/tree/ros2/gazebo_plugins/include/gazebo_plugins>`_ repository for ROS2.

To begin, let’s focus on control. The Thymio is a differential drive robot, so we need a plugin that functions as a differential drive controller. From the repository linked above, you can find the ``gazebo_ros_diff_drive`` plugin, which fulfills this role. The `gazebo_ros_diff_drive.hpp <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/blob/ros2/gazebo_plugins/include/gazebo_plugins/gazebo_ros_diff_drive.hpp>`_ file provides details on how to use this plugin effectively, which we will adapt for our application.

Thymio - Step 5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. admonition:: Thymio

    Open the *gazebo.xacro* file and paste the following code:

    .. code-block:: xml

        <gazebo>
            <plugin name="diff_drive_controller" filename="libgazebo_ros_diff_drive.so">
        
            <!-- Update rate in Hz -->
            <update_rate>50</update_rate>
        
            <!-- wheels -->
            <left_joint>???</left_joint>
            <right_joint>???</right_joint>
        
            <!-- kinematics -->
            <wheel_separation>???</wheel_separation>
            <wheel_diameter>???</wheel_diameter>

            <!-- input -->
            <command_topic>cmd_vel</command_topic>
        
            <!-- output -->
            <publish_odom>true</publish_odom>
            <publish_odom_tf>true</publish_odom_tf>
            <publish_wheel_tf>true</publish_wheel_tf>
        
            <odometry_topic>odom</odometry_topic>
            <odometry_frame>odom</odometry_frame>
            <robot_base_frame>???</robot_base_frame>
        
            </plugin>
        </gazebo>

    This snippet includes the essential elements needed for the Thymio. Replace the ``???`` with the appropriate values. Accurately defining these parameters is critical for precise motion control.  

.. note:: 

    The ``gazebo_ros_diff_drive`` plugin takes velocity commands from the ``cmd_vel`` topic and rotates the wheels accordingly to achieve the desired motion. It also updates TFs and computes odometry for the robot.  

Once the plugin configuration is complete, follow these steps to test it:  

    1. Launch the Gazebo simulation

    .. code-block:: bash

        ros2 launch thymio_description thymio.launch.xml

|spacer|

    2. Send velocity commands from the terminal

    .. code-block::

        ros2 topic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist "{linear: {x: 0.2}, angular: {z: 0.0}}"

    This command sends a *Twist* message, which controls the robot's velocities. The *Twist* type allows control of three linear velocities and three angular velocities. For a differential drive robot like the Thymio, you can only adjust the linear speed in the x-direction and angular speed around the z-axis. 

Experiment with different commands and observe how the robot responds. Additionally, try removing the friction coefficients added to the caster wheel link to explore how this impacts the Thymio's behavior in the simulation. 

.. error::

    Despite addressing most motion-related issues, the robot may still behave unexpectedly when moving backward. Specifically, the Thymio tends to deviate and turn instead of maintaining a straight line. Forward and rotational movements are more stable, so it is recommended to prioritize these and avoid using backward motion whenever possible.

.. admonition:: Break Time

    If this session felt intense, take a moment to relax and have some fun with your Thymio. You can control it using your keyboard by running the following command:

    .. code-block:: bash

        ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard

So far, you have constructed a Thymio model capable of movement using Gazebo's differential drive plugin. However, an essential feature is still missing: **sensors**. 

Typically, adding sensors in a URDF involves the following steps:

    * **Create and position sensor links**: Each sensor requires a dedicated link in the URDF file, accurately placed to match the robot's structure.
    * **Define sensor properties**: Use ``<sensor>`` tags to specify parameters like type, range, and topic names.
    * **Integrate Gazebo plugins**: Add plugins to enable the sensors to function in the simulation environment.

In our case, we want to add proximity sensors to the Thymio, enabling it to detect obstacles.

Thymio - Step 6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. admonition:: Thymio

    Adding multiple sensors manually can be a complex and time-consuming process. To simplify this, we provide a pre-configured file that facilitates the integration of proximity sensors into your Thymio model. Just follow the steps below:

    1. Locate the provided configuration file

    The *proximity_sensors.xacro* file is already included in the */urdf/thymio* directory of the downloaded package.

    2. Include the file in your URDF

    Add the file to *thymio.urdf.xacro*, ensuring it is included after *thymio_chassis.xacro* as it references the ``base_link``.

    3. Adjust the ``base_link`` dimensions

    Update the ``base_link`` length to 0.091 (reduced from 0.11) to correctly position the proximity sensors at the front of the Thymio. This adjustment ensures the sensors are properly positioned outside the chassis while maintaining the robot's real-world dimensions.

Now, you are ready to test the updated model. Build the package and launch the enhanced Thymio in Gazebo to observe the result.

.. code-block:: bash

    ros2 launch thymio_description thymio.launch.xml


Gazebo Worlds - Optional
------------------------

To conclude today's session, let's add the final element needed to achieve a fully functional simulation in ROS2 with Gazebo. So far, we have been working in an empty environment, but to test local avoidance algorithms, it would be beneficial to introduce obstacles into the world. There are two main ways to customize your world:

1. Adding objects

    Open the ``Insert`` panel in Gazebo, where you can find libraries (e.g. http://models.gazebosim.org/) offering various objects to include in your world. When moving an object, hold down ``Shift`` to snap it to the grid for better alignment.

    .. warning::

        When launching Gazebo, it may take some time for the object libraries to load. Be patient, and the list of objects should appear shortly.  

2. Adding walls

    Navigate to *Edit > Building Editor*, which opens a window where you can create custom rooms. The interface consists of two main parts:

    * **Editing interface** (squared sheet): This is where you design your room layout by selecting *Walls* and drawing directly on the grid. You can also add features such as doors and windows by placing them onto the walls.
    * **Preview area**: This section provides a visualization of the room as you design it. You can add textures to the walls directly in this area.

    |spacer|

    Once finished, save your work by going to *File > Save*. Save the room at the default location with your chosen name. Exit the editor via *File > Exit Building Editor*.

    The room you created will now appear as a new object that you can place in your environment. 

After finalizing your environment, ensure the Thymio robot is not part of the saved world. If it is, delete it to avoid having it treated as an object when the world is reopened. Save the world by going to *File > Save World As* and save it as *gazebo_world.world* in the */urdf/world* directory of the *thymio_description* package.

.. note::

    If you open *gazebo_world.world*, you will notice that it is written in SDF (Simulation Description Format), which, like the URDF file, is an XML-based format. The SDF defines Gazebo's simulation environment, specifying objects, lights, physics and environmental parameters.

To spawn the Thymio in your custom environment, you need to update the launch file. Modify *thymio.launch.xml* to ensure the Thymio spawns directly into your world. Replace *empty.world* with *gazebo_world.world* so that the path to your custom world is correctly specified.

After saving the changes, build the package and execute the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    ros2 launch thymio_description thymio.launch.xml
